The maze solver bot traverses the 2D maze using the principles of line following.
It identifies the straight path and turns based on the data given by the IR sensors.
The bot makes the turn using the left hand rule which gives priority to the left turn, meaning if there is a possibility for the left turn, turn left otherwise turn right.
If there is a dead end take a U-turn.
